# Egee's Arch Installer

Welcome to Egee's simple Arch Installer Github repository.

It's a super-simple script that automates the [manual steps](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/installation_guide) required to install Arch Linux!

It's best used as reference architecture for your own script. Or if you want to see what a bare-bones automated Arch install looks like.

**Caution:** This script should only be executed on a live iso or virtual environment! It automatically deletes and recreates all partitions on the target drive, thus wiping any data that may be stored.

The install script is self-documenting. Just run `installer.sh --help` or take a look at the script to see how it works.
